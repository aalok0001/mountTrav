      <p>Nature has an incredible power to heal us both physically
         and mentally. One of the most captivating natural wonders that have been known to have a healing effect on people is mountains. Mountains have a unique ability to create an almost indescribable feeling of awe and wonder. They have a way of reminding us of how small we are in the grand scheme of things, and how much there is to discover beyond ourselves.</p>
